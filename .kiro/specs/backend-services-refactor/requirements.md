# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the backend services of Geo-Asystent AI to improve code quality, maintainability, and production readiness. The refactoring focuses on applying KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principles while improving logging, error handling, and separation of concerns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Logging Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent and proper logging throughout the backend so that I can effectively debug and monitor the application in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any backend operation occurs THEN it SHALL use the logging module instead of print() statements
2. WHEN logging messages are written THEN they SHALL use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with full context including operation details and parameters
4. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL be logged with timing information
5. WHEN LLM operations are executed THEN they SHALL be logged with query details and response metrics
6. WHEN GIS operations are performed THEN they SHALL be logged with spatial query parameters and result counts

### Requirement 2: Error Handling Improvement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want precise and contextual error handling so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues without losing important debugging information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exceptions occur THEN they SHALL be caught with specific exception types rather than generic Exception
2. WHEN errors are logged THEN they SHALL include full context about the operation that failed
3. WHEN database errors occur THEN they SHALL be wrapped in domain-specific exceptions with clear messages
4. WHEN LLM service errors occur THEN they SHALL provide fallback mechanisms and clear error reporting
5. WHEN GIS processing errors occur THEN they SHALL include spatial operation details in error messages
6. WHEN errors are handled THEN they SHALL NOT be silently ignored without logging

### Requirement 3: Code Duplication Elimination (DRY)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate code duplication so that I can maintain the codebase more efficiently and reduce the risk of inconsistent behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN result limiting logic is needed THEN it SHALL use a shared utility function across all services
2. WHEN GeoJSON conversion is performed THEN it SHALL use a common conversion utility
3. WHEN message formatting for parcels is needed THEN it SHALL use a shared message formatter
4. WHEN database connection patterns are used THEN they SHALL be abstracted into reusable components
5. WHEN error response formatting is needed THEN it SHALL use consistent error response builders
6. WHEN validation logic is required THEN it SHALL be centralized and reusable

### Requirement 4: Service Method Simplification (KISS)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want service methods to be simple and focused so that I can easily understand and maintain each method's purpose.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN service methods are implemented THEN each method SHALL have a single, clear responsibility
2. WHEN complex operations are needed THEN they SHALL be broken down into smaller, focused helper methods
3. WHEN data processing occurs THEN it SHALL be separated from business logic and response formatting
4. WHEN validation is performed THEN it SHALL be separated from core business operations
5. WHEN response formatting is needed THEN it SHALL be handled by dedicated formatter functions
6. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL be isolated in repository methods

### Requirement 5: Separation of Concerns

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear separation between different layers of the application so that I can modify one layer without affecting others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are processed THEN routing logic SHALL be separate from business logic
2. WHEN business operations are performed THEN they SHALL be separate from data access logic
3. WHEN data formatting is needed THEN it SHALL be separate from data retrieval and business processing
4. WHEN validation occurs THEN it SHALL be separate from core business operations
5. WHEN error handling is performed THEN it SHALL be consistent across all service layers
6. WHEN configuration is accessed THEN it SHALL be centralized and not scattered throughout service methods

### Requirement 6: Unnecessary Abstraction Removal (YAGNI)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unnecessary abstractions and complexity so that the code is easier to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing service classes THEN they SHALL only contain methods that are actually used
2. WHEN examining helper functions THEN they SHALL only exist if they serve multiple use cases
3. WHEN looking at configuration options THEN they SHALL only include settings that are actually needed
4. WHEN reviewing data models THEN they SHALL only include fields that are actively used
5. WHEN examining utility classes THEN they SHALL be removed if they don't provide clear value
6. WHEN reviewing abstraction layers THEN they SHALL be simplified if they don't add meaningful value

### Requirement 7: Production Readiness

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactored code to be production-ready with proper monitoring and debugging capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in production THEN all operations SHALL be properly logged for monitoring
2. WHEN errors occur in production THEN they SHALL provide enough context for quick resolution
3. WHEN performance issues arise THEN logging SHALL include timing information for key operations
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN log messages SHALL be clear and include relevant context
5. WHEN monitoring the application THEN key metrics SHALL be logged in a structured format
6. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN error messages SHALL be actionable and include suggested solutions

### Requirement 8: Service-Specific Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each service to be optimized for its specific responsibilities while maintaining consistency across the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LLMService operates THEN it SHALL handle prompt loading, response generation, and error fallbacks separately
2. WHEN GISService operates THEN it SHALL separate spatial queries, data processing, and result formatting
3. WHEN IntentService operates THEN it SHALL focus only on classification logic without mixing business operations
4. WHEN LayerConfigService operates THEN it SHALL handle configuration loading and caching efficiently
5. WHEN repository classes operate THEN they SHALL focus only on data access without business logic
6. WHEN utility functions are used THEN they SHALL be stateless and focused on single operations
