# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the Geo-Asystent AI application to improve code readability, maintainability, and overall architecture. The refactoring aims to transform the current monolithic structure into a well-organized, modular codebase that follows best practices and design patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized configuration management so that I can easily modify application settings without hunting through multiple files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load all configuration from a centralized configuration module
2. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with guidance
3. WHEN different environments are used THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configurations
4. WHEN API endpoints change THEN they SHALL be configurable through environment variables

### Requirement 2: Backend Architecture Separation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear separation of concerns in the backend so that I can easily understand, test, and modify individual components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing user queries THEN the intent classification SHALL be separated from business logic execution
2. WHEN accessing database data THEN it SHALL go through a repository layer that abstracts data access
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled through a consistent error handling system
4. WHEN LLM prompts are needed THEN they SHALL be stored in separate template files, not embedded in code
5. WHEN business logic is executed THEN it SHALL be separated from API routing logic

### Requirement 3: Frontend Architecture Improvement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured frontend architecture so that I can easily maintain and extend the user interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls THEN they SHALL go through a centralized API service layer
2. WHEN managing application state THEN it SHALL use custom hooks for business logic
3. WHEN defining data structures THEN they SHALL have proper TypeScript type definitions
4. WHEN handling errors THEN they SHALL be managed consistently across all components
5. WHEN styling components THEN they SHALL follow a consistent styling approach

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging so that I can quickly diagnose and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail levels
2. WHEN API errors happen THEN they SHALL return structured error responses
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN they SHALL provide meaningful error messages
4. WHEN LLM operations fail THEN they SHALL have fallback mechanisms
5. WHEN frontend errors occur THEN they SHALL be displayed user-friendly messages

### Requirement 5: Type Safety and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want strong type safety and input validation so that I can catch errors early and ensure data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN they SHALL be validated against defined schemas
2. WHEN data is processed THEN it SHALL have proper type annotations throughout the codebase
3. WHEN user input is received THEN it SHALL be validated before processing
4. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL use type-safe query builders where possible
5. WHEN API responses are sent THEN they SHALL conform to defined response schemas

### Requirement 6: Code Organization and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-organized and documented code so that new team members can quickly understand and contribute to the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN each module SHALL have a clear, single responsibility
2. WHEN reading function signatures THEN they SHALL have comprehensive docstrings
3. WHEN looking at file structure THEN it SHALL follow consistent naming conventions
4. WHEN reviewing code THEN it SHALL have inline comments explaining complex business logic
5. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN they SHALL have comprehensive project documentation

### Requirement 7: Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust testing infrastructure so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring code THEN it SHALL maintain or improve test coverage
2. WHEN business logic changes THEN unit tests SHALL verify the behavior
3. WHEN API endpoints are modified THEN integration tests SHALL validate the contracts
4. WHEN database operations are updated THEN repository tests SHALL ensure data integrity
5. WHEN frontend components change THEN component tests SHALL verify UI behavior

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactored code to maintain or improve performance while being more maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing GIS queries THEN response times SHALL not degrade from current performance
2. WHEN handling multiple concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL maintain responsiveness
3. WHEN loading map data THEN it SHALL use efficient data structures and algorithms
4. WHEN caching is beneficial THEN it SHALL be implemented at appropriate layers
5. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL be optimized for the expected data volumes
