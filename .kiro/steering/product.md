# Product Overview

Geo-Asystent AI is a GIS (Geographic Information System) chatbot that enables users to interact with geospatial data through natural language queries in Polish. The system combines modern web technologies with AI/LLM capabilities to provide an intuitive interface for GIS operations.

## Core Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Users ask questions in Polish about GIS data (e.g., "pokaż największą działkę", "znajdź budynki w pobliżu GPZ")
- **Interactive Mapping**: Leaflet-based map interface displaying geospatial data with layer controls
- **GIS Operations**: Spatial queries, buffering, area calculations using PostGIS
- **AI-Powered Intent Classification**: LLM (Groq/Llama3) interprets user queries and routes them to appropriate GIS operations

## Target Use Cases

- Geospatial data exploration and visualization
- Property analysis (parcels, buildings)
- Infrastructure analysis (electrical substations)
- Spatial proximity queries and buffering operations
- Portfolio demonstration of cutting-edge GIS + AI integration

## Key Value Proposition

Creates a "wow-effect" by making complex GIS operations accessible through simple Polish language commands, eliminating the need for users to learn traditional GIS software interfaces.
